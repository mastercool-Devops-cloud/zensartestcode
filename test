I did a good work in fed simplification project to achieve the things quickly. I started building my understating from the scratch like started with the low level designing to involved multiple architectural discussions with the other stakeholders, related to the technologies and risk & challenges involved.
I involved to make a reuseable modules like to get the connection establishment in between different microservices.
I work on different tools other than coding like geneos monitoring, setup active mq on UAT boxes, setup git lab configuration on UAT boxes and also worked on migration from git lab to git hub tool.

For FEDS Simplification initiative, I did a POC for NBFI client to convert database procedure into microservices API mappings with different modules of microservices. I demonstrate it Infront of client and got appreciation for the same.

other than FEDS-simplification project, I involved fed dashboard team to solve their problems.
I did a good work in fed dashboard to modify the configuration from development to deployment end to end implementation in non-prod and prod environment.

I also resolved the deployment related issues of other feds team members.
