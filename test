Involved to develop the REST services using Spring boot 3.X with Microservices.
Involved to setup the database connection using oracle database for our different services.
involved to develop the MTLS, Mutual TLS (MTLS) is an enhanced form of TLS authentication where both the client (Podman) and the server (registry) authenticate each other using certificates.
Involved to develop the separate logging modules for Microservices using filter concepts.
Involved to develop the Microservices concept as spring config server to access the properties from another GitHub repo.

I did a good work in fed simplification project to achieve the things quickly. I started building my understating from the scratch like started with the low level designing to involved multiple architectural discussions with the other stakeholders, related to the technologies and risk & challenges involved.
I involved to make a reuseable modules like to get the connection establishment in between different microservices.
I work on different tools other than coding like geneos monitoring, setup active mq on UAT boxes, setup git lab configuration on UAT boxes and also worked on migration from git lab to git hub tool.

For FEDS Simplification initiative, I did a POC for NBFI client to convert database procedure into microservices API mappings with different modules of microservices. I demonstrate it Infront of client and got appreciation for the same.

other than FEDS-simplification project, I involved fed dashboard team to solve their problems.
I did a good work in fed dashboard to modify the configuration from development to deployment end to end implementation in non-prod and prod environment.

I also resolved the deployment related issues of other feds team members.

Developed RESTful services using Spring Boot 3.x following Microservices architecture.

Set up database connections using Oracle Database for various microservices.

Implemented Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client (Podman) and server (registry) authenticate each other using certificates.

Created separate logging modules for microservices using filter concepts.

Developed a centralized Spring Cloud Config Server to fetch properties from a remote GitHub repository.

Implemented CI/CD pipelines for newly created GitHub repositories.

Wrote JUnit test cases to ensure the quality and coverage of developed code.

Created scripts for Geneos monitoring in SB to support service health checks.

Participated in deployment processes using Octopus Deploy.

Contributions and Achievements:
Played a key role in the FEDS Simplification project by rapidly delivering high-quality components. Started from low-level design and actively participated in architectural discussions with stakeholders to assess technology choices, risks, and challenges.

Developed reusable modules to establish secure connections between different microservices.

Worked on a variety of tools beyond development, such as:

Geneos monitoring.

Setting up ActiveMQ on UAT environments.

Configuring GitLab and supporting the migration from GitLab to GitHub.

For the FEDS Simplification initiative, conducted a successful POC for the NBFI client, converting legacy database procedures into modular microservices APIs. Demonstrated the solution to the client and received appreciation for the effort.

Supported the FED Dashboard team by resolving configuration-related issues and contributing to end-to-end implementation, from development to deployment, across both non-prod and prod environments.

Share your experience of working in your project(s)/account(s)/role(s) etc.*
In my current role, I have been extensively involved in developing and enhancing microservices-based applications using Spring Boot 3.x. My contributions span across various phases of the software development lifecycle including design, development, testing, deployment, and monitoring.

As part of the FEDS Simplification project, I played a critical role in driving technical solutions from the ground up. This included creating low-level designs, participating in architectural discussions with stakeholders, and addressing technology choices, risks, and implementation strategies. I developed multiple reusable modules to streamline inter-service communication and improve maintainability.

I also worked on setting up secure communication channels using Mutual TLS (mTLS) and implemented centralized configuration management through Spring Cloud Config Server, which pulled configurations from a GitHub repository. Logging and monitoring were key aspects of the project, and I contributed by creating custom logging modules using filter concepts and developing health monitoring scripts integrated with Geneos.

In terms of DevOps and deployment, I set up CI/CD pipelines for new GitHub repositories and worked hands-on with Octopus Deploy for application releases. I have also supported infrastructure configurations such as setting up ActiveMQ and GitLab in UAT environments, and contributed to the migration from GitLab to GitHub.

One of my key achievements includes delivering a Proof of Concept (POC) for the NBFI client, where I successfully converted complex database procedures into modular microservices APIs. The solution was well-received and appreciated by the client.

Additionally, I collaborated with the FED Dashboard team to resolve critical issues and enhance configuration workflows across development, UAT, and production environments, ensuring smooth end-to-end delivery.

Overall, my role has been a mix of backend development, infrastructure setup, DevOps, and client engagement, contributing to the success and scalability of enterprise-level microservices solutions.

Were you able to achieve this Wellness Goal? What key things you did to achieve your goal? *
Wellness category

physical Wellness -add excercise to your life.
Yes, I was able to make meaningful progress toward my physical wellness goal of adding exercise to my routine. I started by setting small, consistent targets such as walking 30 minutes a day and gradually incorporated strength training and stretching exercises into my weekly routine. I also made a conscious effort to reduce screen time during breaks and replace it with light physical activities. By maintaining a regular schedule and tracking my progress, I was able to stay motivated and develop a sustainable habit. Overall, this helped improve my energy levels, focus, and overall well-being.
Mental Wellness - get more sleep
Yes, I was able to improve my sleep routine as part of my mental wellness goal. I focused on creating a consistent sleep schedule by setting a fixed bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. I also reduced screen time before bed, avoided caffeine in the evening, and created a relaxing pre-sleep routine like reading or listening to calming music. These small changes helped me get better quality sleep, which in turn improved my mood, concentration, and overall mental clarity throughout the day.
Emotional Wellness - Set aside personal boundaries
Yes, I made significant progress in setting and maintaining personal boundaries to support my emotional wellness. I learned to prioritize my well-being by clearly communicating my limits, both in personal and professional settings.
