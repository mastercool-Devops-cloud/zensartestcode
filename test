podman pull aws-tools.standardbank.co.za:8092/cashflow-processor:3.10.0-SNAPSHOT-adb0498 --tls-verify=false

--tls-verify=false

This option disables TLS verification when pulling the image.

It is used when:

The registry does not have a valid SSL/TLS certificate.

You are in a development/testing environment where strict security checks are not enforced.

The registry uses a self-signed or private CA certificate.

--------------------------------
mTLS (Mutual TLS) in Podman
Mutual TLS (mTLS) is an enhanced form of TLS authentication where both the client (Podman) and the server (registry) authenticate each other using certificates.

By default, TLS (one-way) only verifies the server's certificate. In mTLS (two-way), both the server and client present valid certificates.
-------
 How to Use mTLS with Podman Pull?
To enable mTLS while pulling an image, you need:

Server Certificate & Key → Installed on the registry.

Client Certificate & Key → Used by Podman to authenticate to the registry.

Trusted CA Certificate → To verify the registry's certificate.
-------
Required Files in /path/to/certs/
File Name	Description
ca.crt	CA certificate that signed the registry’s certificate
client.cert	Client certificate (issued by the same CA)
client.key	Private key for the client certificate
