Involved to develop the REST services using Spring boot 3.X with Microservices.
Involved to setup the database connection using oracle database for our different services.
involved to develop the MTLS, Mutual TLS (MTLS) is an enhanced form of TLS authentication where both the client (Podman) and the server (registry) authenticate each other using certificates.
Involved to develop the separate logging modules for Microservices using filter concepts.
Involved to develop the Microservices concept as spring config server to access the properties from another GitHub repo.
Involved to develop the CI/CD pipeline for our newly setup GitHub repo.
Involved to write the JUnit test case for developed code.
Involved to develop the script to monitor Geneos Tool in SB for health checkups.
Involved in deployment using Octopus deployments.

I did a good work in fed simplification project to achieve the things quickly. I started building my understating from the scratch like started with the low level designing to involved multiple architectural discussions with the other stakeholders, related to the technologies and risk & challenges involved.
I involved to make a reuseable modules like to get the connection establishment in between different microservices.
I work on different tools other than coding like geneos monitoring, setup active mq on UAT boxes, setup git lab configuration on UAT boxes and also worked on migration from git lab to git hub tool.

For FEDS Simplification initiative, I did a POC for NBFI client to convert database procedure into microservices API mappings with different modules of microservices. I demonstrate it Infront of client and got appreciation for the same.

other than FEDS-simplification project, I involved fed dashboard team to solve their problems.
I did a good work in fed dashboard to modify the configuration from development to deployment end to end implementation in non-prod and prod environment.

I also resolved the deployment related issues of other feds team members.

Developed RESTful services using Spring Boot 3.x following Microservices architecture.

Set up database connections using Oracle Database for various microservices.

Implemented Mutual TLS (mTLS) authentication where both client (Podman) and server (registry) authenticate each other using certificates.

Created separate logging modules for microservices using filter concepts.

Developed a centralized Spring Cloud Config Server to fetch properties from a remote GitHub repository.

Implemented CI/CD pipelines for newly created GitHub repositories.

Wrote JUnit test cases to ensure the quality and coverage of developed code.

Created scripts for Geneos monitoring in SB to support service health checks.

Participated in deployment processes using Octopus Deploy.

Contributions and Achievements:
Played a key role in the FEDS Simplification project by rapidly delivering high-quality components. Started from low-level design and actively participated in architectural discussions with stakeholders to assess technology choices, risks, and challenges.

Developed reusable modules to establish secure connections between different microservices.

Worked on a variety of tools beyond development, such as:

Geneos monitoring.

Setting up ActiveMQ on UAT environments.

Configuring GitLab and supporting the migration from GitLab to GitHub.

For the FEDS Simplification initiative, conducted a successful POC for the NBFI client, converting legacy database procedures into modular microservices APIs. Demonstrated the solution to the client and received appreciation for the effort.

Supported the FED Dashboard team by resolving configuration-related issues and contributing to end-to-end implementation, from development to deployment, across both non-prod and prod environments.
