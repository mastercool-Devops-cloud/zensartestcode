Approach	When to Use?
✅ @Component with @Autowired Constructor	When you want BaseLogDetails as a Spring-managed bean
✅ @Bean in Configuration	If you want BaseLogDetails as a POJO but still inject values automatically

What about a normal internal information log? For example to say that something was successful
