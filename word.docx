how to crate different podman machine for dev and uat environment

To create different Podman machines for Dev and UAT environments, you can utilize Podman's machine management features, which allow you to set up isolated environments (machines) on a single host system. Each machine will act like a separate virtual machine with its own configuration and containers.

Steps to Create Different Podman Machines for Dev and UAT
1. Install Podman on Your System
Ensure Podman is installed on your system. If it's not installed, follow the installation instructions for your OS.

2. Create the Dev Podman Machine
Create the Dev Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine init dev-machine
dev-machine: This is the name of the machine you are creating for the Dev environment.
Start the Dev Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine start dev-machine
Access the Dev Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine ssh dev-machine
This command connects you to the dev-machine environment, where you can run Podman commands to manage containers and pods for your Dev environment.

3. Create the UAT Podman Machine
Create the UAT Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine init uat-machine
uat-machine: This is the name of the machine you are creating for the UAT environment.
Start the UAT Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine start uat-machine
Access the UAT Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine ssh uat-machine
This command connects you to the uat-machine environment, where you can run Podman commands to manage containers and pods for your UAT environment.

4. Switching Between Dev and UAT Machines
To switch between the Dev and UAT environments, you can stop one machine and start the other:

Stop the Current Machine (if running):

bash
Copy code
podman machine stop
Start the Desired Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine start dev-machine  # For Dev
podman machine start uat-machine  # For UAT
SSH into the Desired Machine:

bash
Copy code
podman machine ssh dev-machine  # For Dev
podman machine ssh uat-machine  # For UAT
5. Managing Pods and Containers in Each Environment
Once you're inside the specific Podman machine (Dev or UAT), you can create pods, run containers, and manage your environment as needed.

Example for Dev:

bash
Copy code
podman pod create --name fed-deam_management
podman run -d --pod fed-deam_management --name casflow-processor-container -p 8092:8092 myapp1-image
Example for UAT:

bash
Copy code
podman pod create --name fed-trade
podman run -d --pod fed-trade --name a-container -p 8080:8080 myapp2-image
6. Checking the Status of Machines
To list all Podman machines and their statuses:

bash
Copy code
podman machine list
This will show you all machines, whether they are running or stopped, and other details like their names, disk usage, and more.

Summary
Podman Machines: These are isolated environments that behave like separate virtual machines, each with its own configuration and containers.
Dev and UAT Machines: You can create different machines for Dev and UAT, allowing you to keep environments isolated from each other.
Managing Machines: You can start, stop, and ssh into these machines to manage your containers and pods within the specific environment.
This setup allows you to cleanly separate your Dev and UAT environments, making it easier to manage different stages of your application lifecycle.
