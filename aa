So I need you to do something that checks what the service name is. If it is from your service for example the log service.
But then log it out as a Jason object. 

<Configuration status="INFO">
    <Properties>
        <Property name="log4j.configurationFile">log4j2.yml, log4j2-component.yml</Property>
    </Properties>
</Configuration>
