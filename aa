Lets rename the other factory to a service(which it seems to be) and in that service use the actual factory to create the log and the service can print it. This is class is handling a lot of the log logic but it is just a filter.

This is a service and not a factory, it should perhaps use the factory to create the log and print it so the other classes can do less logging logic.

Please don't catch just to throw a generic runtime exception. Either use a personal one or throw the one that would naturally occur here in the right context, you could also think of adding throws to the signature to force handling the runtime exception type so it does break the project at any point.
