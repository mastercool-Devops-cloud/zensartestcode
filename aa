So I need you to do something that checks what the service name is. If it is from your service for example the log service.
But then log it out as a Jason object. 

try creating a Pinder that logs a Jason object here that comes from your service, because what's gonna happen is we're gonna bring this into the other project, but you still wanna bend the others as.
