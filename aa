The decision between using "one container per pod per application" versus "multiple containers per pod" depends on the specific architecture, deployment needs, and how tightly coupled the containers are. Let's analyze the two scenarios:

1. One Container Per Pod Per Application
Advantages:
Isolation: Each container runs in its own pod, ensuring strong isolation. If a container fails or needs to be updated, only that specific application is affected.
Simplicity: Each pod is simpler to manage, as it only contains one container. Scaling up is straightforward—just add more replicas of the pod.
Independence: Easier to manage and deploy individual containers without worrying about their interactions with other containers within the same pod.
Scaling Flexibility: You can independently scale each application by scaling its respective pod without affecting others.
Disadvantages:
Overhead: More pods mean more overhead in terms of resource usage, especially in a large deployment. This can also complicate networking since each pod gets its own IP.
Inter-Container Communication: If applications need to communicate with each other, they have to do so over the network, which can introduce latency and complexity.
When to Use:
When the containers are loosely coupled or serve distinct purposes.
When each application has different scaling requirements.
When you require strong isolation between containers.
When each application is relatively simple and does not need to share resources closely with others.
2. Multiple Containers Per Pod
Advantages:
Shared Resources: Containers in the same pod share the same network namespace, IP address, and can easily share volumes, making communication and data sharing straightforward.
Tight Coupling: Ideal for closely related containers that need to work together, such as a web server and a sidecar proxy, or a main application and a log collector.
Reduced Overhead: Since multiple containers share the same pod, there's less overhead in terms of resource allocation and networking.
Disadvantages:
Complexity: Managing and orchestrating multiple containers within a single pod can be complex. All containers in the pod are restarted together, which might not be desirable if only one container needs updating or has an issue.
Scaling Constraints: You can't independently scale the containers within a pod. If you need more instances of one container but not the others, you're forced to replicate the entire pod.
Tight Coupling Risks: If one container in the pod fails, it might impact the others. This tight coupling can lead to difficulties in maintenance and updates.
When to Use:
When containers are tightly coupled and need to communicate frequently or share storage.
When you have a sidecar pattern (e.g., logging, monitoring, or proxy sidecars) where one container supports the main application.
When the containers are part of a single logical application, and you need them to be co-located.
When reducing networking overhead between containers is important.
Decision-Making Summary:
Choose One Container Per Pod Per Application if:

Your applications are independent of each other.
You need flexibility in scaling and deploying each application.
You prefer strong isolation between different applications.
Choose Multiple Containers Per Pod if:

Your containers are part of a tightly coupled application that benefits from co-location and shared resources.
You are implementing a sidecar pattern where auxiliary services run alongside the main application container.
You want to reduce inter-container communication overhead within the same logical application.
Practical Examples:
One Container Per Pod: A microservices architecture where each service is independently deployed and scaled, with each service (e.g., user service, payment service) running in its own pod.
Multiple Containers Per Pod: A web server container (e.g., Nginx) paired with a logging container (e.g., Fluentd) that collects logs from the web server, both running in the same pod.
In most modern microservices architectures, one container per pod per application is the common approach due to the benefits of isolation and scalability. However, when there’s a clear case for tight coupling, multiple containers per pod can be the more efficient choice.
