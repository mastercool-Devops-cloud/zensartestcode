IBM MQ Spring Starter makes it easy to send and receive messages from an MQ Service using Spring's JmsTemplate API, with Spring auto configuration.

In this tutorial, you learned how to develop MQ JMS applications with Spring Boot. You could follow one of two sets of steps:

A simpler set of steps that provide a minimal code base where you initiated sending and receiving messages from an MQ service using Spring's JmsTemplate API, leveraging Spring's auto-configuration feature.
A more advanced set of steps that explored how to structure Spring Boot projects using the MVC design pattern, offering valuable insights into building robust messaging applications with Spring Boot and IBM MQ.
